This is their life now.&#x201D;</p><p>Since 2011, according to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, over 950,000 European asylum applications have been submitted by Syrians. Approximately 6 million people have been displaced within the country, and over 5 million have fled across Syrian borders.   </p><p>The Karam Foundation focused on serving the individuals and families that make up these statistics in a very purposeful form of aid. What the foundation calls &#x201C;smart aid.&#x201D;</p><p>Methods traditionally used by other humanitarian organizations to deliver aid have helped, but have not led to the development of sustainable methods or programs for areas of need, said Nadari.</p><p>&#x201C;Food baskets are not sustainable,&#x201D; Nadari said. &#x201C;They want to live with dignity. They don&#x2019;t want to depend on aid that may or may not come.&#x201D;In order to solve problems with resource delivery, the Karam Foundation went to the people on the ground who actually receive the aid for ideas.</p><p>Projects within the smart aid program include: education programs focused on young refugees in Southern Turkey, formula and milk delivery for mothers who cannot produce breast milk due to the traumas they have suffered during the civil war, and providing food to devastated areas within the country from local Syrian farmers, simultaneously helping those in need and boosting the local economy.</p><div><blockquote class="Theme-Layer-BodyText-Blockquote"><strong>&#x201C;Interest comes in waves...When there isn&#x2019;t a viral image or a chemical weapons attack, I think [Syria] falls off people&#x2019;s radars.&#x201D;</strong><footer><cite class="Theme-Layer-BodyText-QuoteCite">&#x2013; Roya Nadari, Communications Director, Karam Foundation</cite></footer></blockquote></div><p>While the Karam Foundation is primarily focused on populations displaced internationally, it has recently begun developing programs for refugees in the United States due to the growing population of Syrian refugees who have entered into the country since 2011.</p><p>Syrian refugee entrances into the United States saw an increase in 2015 according to analyzed data provided by the State Department&#x2019;s Refugee Processing Center.</p><p>Between fiscal years 2010 and 2013, the average number of Syrian refugee entrants into the United States was 27, never reaching a higher level than 36 in 2013.</p><p>This number began to increase dramatically after 2013.</p><p>In 2014, there were 105 entrants; in 2015, that number increased over ten times to 1,682.
